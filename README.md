UBC Math 152 Lecture Notes
==========================

Joel Feldman, Richard Froese, Brian Wetton and others.

These are the lecture notes for UBC's Math 152 Linear Systems
course on linear algebra and applications.

The notes have been in-use since at least 2004 and many people have
[contributed](https://github.com/UBCMath/Math152notes/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.txt)
over the years.  A UBC Skylight grant supported some student work during 2009.
